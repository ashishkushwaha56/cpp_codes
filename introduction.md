# Data Types
Data type is nothing but different types of storage that we use to store the data in our program. By creating the specific data type we tell the compiler how to use the storage for data and how to manipulate these storage.

Data types can be build-in or abstract. A build-in data type is the one about which compiler already have knowledge that those are defined in the library.

Below are some common known build-in data types.
```cpp
int // Data type to store Integer number
bool // Data type to store boolean value
char // Data type to store a single character
float // Data type to store a floating number with precision value upto 7 decimal places
double // Data type to store a floating number with higher precision value i.e. it has 15 precision value upto 15 decimal places
string // Data type to store an array of characters
```
## Built-in data types
There are generally four types of built-in data types. A `int` stores the numerical value which takes minimum of two bytes and maximum of four bytes depending on the system and the number that it can store is in from -2147483648 to 2147483647. The `float` and `double` store floating point numbers. The `float` is a single precision floating point which means it can store the decimal number upto 7 decimal places and it takes 4 bytes of memory storage. Similarly `double` is for double precision floating point thats why it can store a decimal number upto 15 decimal places and 8 bytes required to store the floating point as a `double`. A `char` is for storing a character which uses 1 byte of storage and the range of the storage is from -128 to 127.
